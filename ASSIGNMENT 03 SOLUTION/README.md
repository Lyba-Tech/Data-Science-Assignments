# Assignment 3: Python Fundamentals

For Assignment 3, I explored essential concepts in Python programming, focusing on lists, tuples, input/output operations, and operators. This assignment was an excellent opportunity to solidify my grasp of these core Python concepts and showcase my ability to apply them effectively.

## Key Tasks Completed

### Lists and Tuples

- **Lists**: Created an empty list named `my_list` and performed various operations including appending, inserting, and removing elements.
- **Tuples**: Explored tuple creation, unpacking, concatenation, and accessed elements using both positive and negative indexing to illustrate their immutability.

### Input and Output

- **User Interaction**: Utilized the `input()` function to prompt users for their names and display a personalized welcome message.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Prompted the user to input two numbers, converted them to integers, calculated their sum and product, and displayed the results using formatted output.

### Operators

- **Arithmetic Operators**: Used the modulus operator to determine if a number is even or odd.
- **Comparison Operators**: Verified if a number is greater than or equal to 10.
- **Logical Operators**: Combined logical operators to create and evaluate a complex condition, printing the result.

## Submission Details

To submit this assignment, I saved my Python code in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file and uploaded it to my GitHub repository. The repository link was shared for evaluation.

Completing Assignment 3 was a valuable experience that enhanced my understanding of Python fundamentals and improved my programming skills.
