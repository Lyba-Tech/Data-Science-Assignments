The modified list is converted back into a tuple.

**e) Displaying the Final Tuple**  
The final tuple is printed after modification.

## Question 3: Sets

**a) Creating Sets**  
Two sets are created with random integers.

**b) Performing Set Operations**  
Set operations including union, intersection, and difference are performed and results are displayed.

**c) Subset and Superset Check**  
Checks are made to determine if one set is a subset or superset of the other, and the results are printed.

## Question 4: Dictionaries

**a) Creating a Dictionary**  
A dictionary with fruit names as keys and their prices as values is created.

**b) Adding Key-Value Pairs**  
New key-value pairs are added to the dictionary.

**c) Accessing a Specific Key**  
The value of a specific key in the dictionary is accessed and printed.

**d) Modifying an Existing Key**  
The value of an existing key is modified, and the updated dictionary is printed.

**e) Deleting a Key-Value Pair**  
A key-value pair is deleted from the dictionary, and the updated dictionary is printed.

**f) Displaying the Final Dictionary**  
The final state of the dictionary is printed after all operations.

## Question 5: Employee Data Management

**a) Creating Employee Records**  
A list of employee records, each represented as a dictionary, is created.

**b) Calculating Average Salary**
